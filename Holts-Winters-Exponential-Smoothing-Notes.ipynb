    "- **Weighted Moving Average**\n",
    "    - Is the moving average where within the sliding window values are given different weights, typically so that more recent points matter more.\n",
    "    - Instead of selecting a window size, it requires a list of weights(**These weights should add up to 1**).\n",
    "    - Example: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4] gives weights to the last 4 observations and the highest is given to the most recent one\n",

    "    - Just like weighted moving average with two weights: $a$ and $(1-a)$\n",
